### What I learned

   What I learned was using CSS3 to make the main style of the page for some people may be easy but for me was challenging to 
   be able to come up with code only from my notes and my research to do what was requested.

   .qr-body {
    border-radius: 20px;
    border: transparent;
    background-color: var(--background-border);
    width: 251px;
    position: absolute;
    left: 38%;
    top: 20%;
}
